Description: Flanker task (event-related)

The "NYU Slow Flanker" dataset comprises data collected from 26 healthy
adults (age and sex included in Slow_Flanker_age_sex.txt) while they 
performed a slow event-related Eriksen Flanker task.

**Please note that all data have been uploaded regardless of quality
it is up to the user to check for data quality (movement etc).

On each trial (inter-trial interval (ITI) varied between 8 s and 14 s;
mean ITI=12 s),participants used one of two buttons on a response pad
to indicate the direction of a central arrow in an array of 5 arrows.
In congruent trials the flanking arrows pointed in the same direction
as the central arrow (e.g., < < < < <), while in more demanding
incongruent trials the flanking arrows pointed in the opposite
direction (e.g., < < > < <). 

Subjects performed two 5-minute blocks, each containing 12 congruent
and 12 incongruent trials, presented in a pseudorandom order.

Functional imaging data were acquired using a research dedicated Siemens
Allegra 3.0 T scanner, with a standard Siemens head coil, located at the
NYU Center for Brain Imaging.

We obtained 146 contiguous echo planar imaging (EPI) whole-brainfunctional
volumes (TR=2000 ms; TE=30 ms; flip angle=80, 40 slices, matrix=64x64; FOV=192 mm; acquisition voxel size=3x3x4mm) during each of the two flanker task blocks. A high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical image was also acquired using a magnetization prepared gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE, TR=2500 ms; TE=
3.93 ms; TI=900 ms; flip angle=8; 176 slices, FOV=256 mm).
